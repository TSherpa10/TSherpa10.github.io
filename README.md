### This repository includes my resume, my accolades, and my experiences all in one site.

## Goal: To create a React.js website portfolio to showcase my experience and retrain my frontend skills, all the while having fun making a website.

## Timeline:

### April 21st: Created quokka-talent and set up React.js application.

### By May: Create Landing Page, all quokka-themed, and have two separate buttons for my resume (one for viewing as an overlay, another as a downloadable option).
